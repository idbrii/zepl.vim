* Configurability

  - Maybe make the bufnr publicly accessible (but locked).
    - Return from zepl#start() and zepl#jump() ?
  - Typing speed controls (e.g. for use over serial connections with picocom).


* New functionality

  - Extract output from terminal buffer.  `:h term_scrape()`
  - Multiple REPL support.
    - Vim prompt asking which REPL to use.
    - Set 'cmd' to a list of strings, or set 'cmd' to a Vim function.
      - The function can then do the prompting and ask for additional info.
    - In contrib?


* Usability

  - Contrib modules with better defaults for specific languages.
    - Python, F#, Clojure, etc.
    - E.g. runtime! zepl/contrib/fsharp_defaults.vim
      - Auto-enable and configure load-files, cmd and formatter.
      - Bind 'keywordprg' to a useful value.
      - Helper commands and functions.
